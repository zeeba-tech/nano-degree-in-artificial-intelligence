In fully-connected networks, the input to each layer must be a one-dimensional vector (which can be stacked into a 2D tensor as a batch of multiple examples). However, our images are 28x28 2D tensors, so we need to convert them into 1D vectors. Thinking about sizes, we need to convert the batch of images with shape (64, 1, 28, 28) to a have a shape of (64, 784), 784 is 28 times 28. This is typically called flattening, we flattened the 2D images into 1D vectors.\n",

This ends up being a discrete probability distribution over the classes (digits) that tells us the most likely class for the image. That means we need 10 output units for the 10 classes (digits). We'll see how to convert the network output into a probability distribution next.\n",

Note that you'll need to pay attention to the shapes when doing this. If you have a tensor a with shape (64, 10) and a tensor b with shape (64,), doing a/b will give you an error because PyTorch will try to do the division across the columns (called broadcasting) but you'll get a size mismatch. The way to think about this is for each of the 64 examples, you only want to divide by one value, the sum in the denominator. So you need b to have a shape of (64, 1). This way PyTorch will divide the 10 values in each row of a by the one value in each row of b. Pay attention to how you take the sum as well. You'll need to define the dim keyword in torch.sum. Setting dim=0 takes the sum across the rows while dim=1 takes the sum across the columns."
