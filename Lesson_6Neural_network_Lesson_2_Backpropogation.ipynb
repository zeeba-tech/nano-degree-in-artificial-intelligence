        "Now we've come to the problem of how to make a multilayer neural network learn. Before, we saw how to update weights with gradient descent. The backpropagation algorithm is just an extension of that, using the chain rule to find the error with the respect to the weights connecting the input layer to the hidden layer (for a two layer network).\n",

        "To update the weights to hidden layers using gradient descent, you need to know how much error each of the hidden units contributed to the final output. Since the output of a layer is determined by the weights between layers, the error resulting from units is scaled by the weights going forward through the network. Since we know the error at the output, we can use the weights to work backwards to hidden layers.\n",

The maximum derivative of the sigmoid function is 0.25, so the errors in the output layer get reduced by at least 75%, and errors in the hidden layer are scaled down by at least 93.75%! You can see that if you have a lot of layers, using a sigmoid activation function will quickly reduce the weight steps to tiny values in layers near the input. This is known as the vanishing gradient problem. Later in the course you'll learn about other activation functions that perform better in this regard and are more commonly used in modern network architectures.\n",
