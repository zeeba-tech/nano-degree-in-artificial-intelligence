        "To install Python and follow this lesson, you will need to use the command line. We will walk you through all the details, so don't worry if you have never used it before! If you would like to learn or refresh on command lines, we strongly recommend going through this free Shell Workshop lesson, where you can set up and learn how to use Unix Shell commands.\n",

        "** Note to Windows Users: Install Git Bash\n",
        "As noted in the free Shell Workshop linked above, we recommend you install Git Bash here and use this as your terminal for this lesson. Please note that during installation you should select the checkbox Use Git and Optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt. This will allow you to use Unix commands while in Windows. If you'd rather use PowerShell, those commands are also provided in this lesson. For more information on the different command shells, check out the Shell Workshop lesson linked above.\n",

        "Mac OS X and Linux usually come with Python 2 already installed. We DO NOT recommend that you make any changes to this Python, since parts of the operating system are using Python. However, it shouldn't do any harm to your system to install Python 3 separately, too.\n",
        "\n",

It also makes it really easy to set up different environments on your computer so you can quickly switch between different versions of Python and packages! For example, if one project you're working on requires Python 2.7 and another requires Python 3.6, as well as different dependencies, then Anaconda's environment management can help.\n",
