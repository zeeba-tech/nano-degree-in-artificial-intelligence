        "We can actually import Python code from other scripts, which is helpful if you are working on a bigger project where you want to organize your code into multiple files and reuse code in those files. If the Python script you want to import is in the same directory as your current script, you just type import followed by the name of the file, without the .py extension.\n",

        "It's the standard convention for import statements to be written at the top of a Python script, each one on a separate line. This import statement creates a module object called useful_functions. Modules are just Python files that contain definitions and statements. To access objects from an imported module, you need to use dot notation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Whenever we run a script like this, Python actually sets a special built-in variable called __name__ for any module. When we run a script, Python recognizes this module as the main program, and sets the __name__ variable for this module to the string \"__main__\". For any modules that are imported in this script, this built-in __name__ variable is just set to the name of that module. Therefore, the condition if __name__ == \"__main__\"is just checking whether this module is the main program.\n",
