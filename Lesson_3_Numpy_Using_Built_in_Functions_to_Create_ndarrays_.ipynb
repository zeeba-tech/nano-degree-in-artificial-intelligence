The np.linspace(start, stop, N) function returns N evenly spaced numbers over the closed interval [start, stop]. This means that both the start and thestop values are included. We should also note the np.linspace() function needs to be called with at least two arguments in the form np.linspace(start,stop). In this case, the default number of elements in the specified interval will be N= 50.

For example, you can convert a rank 1 ndarray with 6 elements, into a 3 x 2 rank 2 ndarray, or a 2 x 3 rank 2 ndarray, since both of these rank 2 arrays will have a total of 6 elements. However, you can't reshape the rank 1 ndarray with 6 elements into a 3 x 3 rank 2 ndarray, since this rank 2 array will have 9 elements, which is greater than the number of elements in the original ndarray.

        "As we can see, we get the exact same result as before. Notice that when we use reshape() as a method, it's applied as ndarray.reshape(new_shape). This converts the ndarray into the specified shape new_shape. As before, it is important to note that the new_shape should be compatible with the number of elements in ndarray. In the example above, the function np.arange(20) creates an ndarray and serves as the ndarray to be reshaped by the reshape() method. Therefore, when using reshape() as a method, we don't need to pass the ndarray as an argument to the reshape() function, instead we only need to pass the new_shape argument.\n",
