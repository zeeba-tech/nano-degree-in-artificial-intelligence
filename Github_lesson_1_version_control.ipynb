        "I just said \"version control\". Now since you're in this course, you might already know a bit about version control. But if you don't, a handy trick I've learned is to try reading the words in reverse - so \"version control\" would become \"control version\"! So a Version Control System is just software that helps you control (or manage) the different versions...of something (typically source code).\n",

If needed, you can also jump back to any point in the project to recover data or files.\n",
