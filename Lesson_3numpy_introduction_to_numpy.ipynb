        "NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently. These lessons are intended as a basic overview of NumPy and introduce some of its most important features.\n",
